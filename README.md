## Introduction
# Introduction

This project implements features for an OrangeHRM system using Cucumber. 

Cucumber is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework that facilitates the creation of acceptance tests written in a Gherkin syntax that is easily understandable by both technical and non-technical users. It allows for the creation of executable specifications that document how the system should behave from a user's perspective.

This project utilizes Cucumber to define acceptance tests for the OrangeHRM system's functionalities. These tests ensure that the system behaves as expected and meets the requirements outlined for each feature.

The provided URL (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login) appears to be a demo login page for an OrangeHRM system. It's likely that this project interacts with this demo site in order to test the OrangeHRM functionalities.

By combining Cucumber with OrangeHRM, this project aims to streamline the development and testing processes, resulting in a more robust and user-friendly system.
